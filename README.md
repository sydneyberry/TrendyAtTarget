Looking for a shopping suggestion? Lost among the constantly changing trends? There are SO many trends to keep track of and we wanted to implement a way to find items that fit those trends out of the hundreds of items avaliable on Target's website. **Trendy @ Target is a feature that provides shopping suggestions categorized by current trends.**

Trends will be identified by keeping track of what is currently being talked about on fashion blogs and websites through a web scraper. Using keywords that correspond to each trend, products on the Target website are grouped accordingly, which then allows guests to view products according to trend.
